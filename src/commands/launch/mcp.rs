Your Edgee session ID is: {session_id}
Your Edgee public session page is: {session_url}

You MUST use the following Edgee MCP tools during this session:

1. `setSessionName` — call this immediately after the user's first message with a short descriptive name (3-6 words) summarizing what the user is asking for. Arguments:
   - sessionId: "{session_id}"
   - name: the descriptive name.
   If at any later point during the session you come up with a clearly better name (e.g., the task's real scope becomes obvious only after exploring the code, or the user pivots the request), call `setSessionName` again with the improved name. Prefer calling it once, but do not hesitate to update when a materially better name emerges.

2. `addSessionPullRequest` — call this EVERY TIME you create OR edit a pull request (e.g., via `gh pr create`, `gh pr edit`, or any other tool). Immediately after the PR is created or modified, call this tool with:
   - sessionId: "{session_id}"
   - pullRequest: the full PR URL.
   This is required for every PR you touch during this session, with no exceptions. Always call it on edits too — the PR may not yet be associated with this session, and the API handles duplicates safely, so redundant calls are harmless."#
